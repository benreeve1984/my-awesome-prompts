# XYZPrompt for LLM Developer Agent: AI Prompt Management & Version Control Application

## Objective
Build a comprehensive **Prompt Storage & Management** application tailored specifically for AI prompt engineers. This app must seamlessly integrate with GitHub to manage Markdown (`.md`) prompts, providing robust version control, collaboration tools, LLM-generated commit messages, project-based grouping, evaluation attachment features, and engaging community-sharing capabilities.

---

## Key Features & Functional Requirements

### 1. GitHub Integration & Version Control
- Allow users to link existing GitHub repositories or create new ones directly in-app.
- Support standard Git operations: clone, fetch, branch, edit, commit, push, and pull.
- Automatically generate descriptive commit messages using an LLM based on file diffs.
  - Example LLM instruction: _"Summarize the changes in `prompt.md` into a concise commit message."_
- Provide visual diffs and history for each prompt file.

### 2. Project-Based Prompt Grouping
- Enable users to organize multiple prompt files into clearly named **projects**.
- Allow intuitive switching between projects and easy viewing of grouped prompts.
- Include tagging and metadata for improved searchability and organization.

### 3. Evaluation & Testing Support
- Allow attaching evaluation results or performance metrics directly to specific prompt versions or combinations.
- Evaluation metadata could include:
  - Success rates or accuracy scores
  - Qualitative comments or notes
  - References to test scenarios
- Facilitate easy snapshotting, tagging, and retrieval of specific prompt version combinations for replication and testing.

### 4. Community Sharing & Discovery
- Allow prompt engineers to share their repositories publicly within the app.
- Display public repositories prominently with engaging summaries, tags, and GitHub metrics:
  - Stars, forks, contributors, recent activity
- Provide easy sorting and filtering of repositories by community metrics (e.g., popularity, recent updates, stars).

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

- **Front End:**
  - Use a modern framework (React/Vue/Svelte) with a responsive UI.
  - Include rich Markdown editing capabilities, syntax highlighting, and live preview.

- **Back End & APIs:**
  - Leverage GitHub's REST or GraphQL APIs for repository management.
  - Secure OAuth integration with GitHub for authentication.

- **Data Storage:**
  - Primarily store prompts as Markdown files within GitHub repositories.
  - Store evaluation metadata as JSON or Markdown front-matter within the same GitHub repositories for versioning.

- **Auto-Commit LLM Integration:**
  - Clearly defined API calls to an LLM service to summarize changes as commit messages.

---

## User Experience & Interface

- **Dashboard:** Overview of projects, recent activity, and repository stats.
- **Prompt Editor:** Markdown-friendly editor with live preview, integrated Git actions, and commit message suggestions.
- **Evaluation Management:** Simple interface to add, edit, or view evaluations tied to prompt versions.
- **Community Portal:** Browsable, sortable directory of shared prompt repositories with community metrics.

---

## Security & Permissions
- Strictly enforce GitHub-based OAuth authentication.
- Clearly define permissions for public viewing vs. private editing of prompt repositories.

---

## Deliverables
- Complete and production-ready codebase.
- Comprehensive documentation (setup guide, user guide, API documentation).
- Example/demo repository illustrating full app functionality.
